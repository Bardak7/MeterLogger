Analysis
--------

The objective of this project is not to create a power efficient meter logger but to reduce overall heating usage for ca 1000 people.
So to talk about power usage in this project can not be isolated from the greater scale of the Nabovarme project.

The ESP8266's power usage statistics can be seen in the table below:

table from nurd space

In this table a few sample situations and their current drain can be seen.


The implications of meter logger on the Nabovarme project can be:

If the ESP8266 knows the temperature the water in each household then we dont have to produce and distribute
max heated water to all households unless they need it.
We imagine that an meter logger notifies the heating production when its local warm water container drops below
a certain threshold. This will have a major influence when for example at night when nobody is using warm water etc.

Another dimension is to give people a live view of their usage.
We imagine that if a user can see and follow a live correlation between heating usage and money spent they will react by changing their behaviour.
The reasons can be economically but also ecologically since we can also corellate usage with ressource usage and notify people on how many trees are flowing through their radiators.
