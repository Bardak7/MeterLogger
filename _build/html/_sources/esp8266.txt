   The esp8266 module family and the esp8266-01 i am using in this project. 
   Note also the esp8266-07 with fcc stamps.

The ESP8266 is a new microcontroller with onboard wifi sold in modules including a  512 kb spi flash.
It was introduced to the global market by Espressif in 2014 and has since gained a large following in
hacker and maker circles around the world.

Espressif has released an sdk for the ESP8266 and have kept updating the sdk for the bimonthly.
The sdk has some binary blobs but a project called Esp-open-sdk tries to replace these with open source alternatives.
The binary blobs make it a little dificult to develop software for the esp since you cant research the inner workings of specific core api calls.

The sdk is based on freertos and give you a task handler asn other abstract os features.
Most of its core api calls are callback based which means you have to think asynchronously when developing.

Esp8266 family
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I chose to use the esp8266-01 in this project because it was ready made and included 
header pins for easy prototyping.
The esp-01 however is the most sparsely broken out module of the family. The esp8266 chip itself features a lengthy list of gpios including uarts, i2c, spi etc. While all these features exist aboard the esp-01 only a few a broken out, namlely two gpio's and a single uart.
This however is enough to implement my prototype.

**Esp8266-07**
This module will propably be the one that the next prototype will use. Reasons are:

* Faraday cage
* cheramic antenna 
* connector for external antenna
* more gpios broken out
  
The external antenna ability would provide much needed better wifi receptance in the indoor environments where the meters are installed.

PCB
,,,

The kamstrup meters are designed with a space for extension boards. (see the image in start of design section)
A pcb layout was created in order to host the ESP8266-01 and facilitate uart connectivity with the kamstrup bus as well as providing power from the builtin psu.

The pcb was uploaded to the pcb manufacturer *"oshpark.com"* where it is released as open hardware. Oshpark creates cheap pcb's with their purple signature tint.
Eagle cad free edition was used for the pcb layout and the design files are in the github repository.
