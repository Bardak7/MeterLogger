ESP8266
.......


The ESP8266 is a new microcontroller with onboard wifi and 512 kb spi flash.
It was introduced to the global market by Espressif in 2014 and has since gained a large following in
hacker and maker circles around the world.

Espressif has released an sdk for the ESP8266 and have kept updating the sdk for the bimonthly.
The sdk has some binary blobs but a project called Esp-open-sdk tries to replace these with open source alternatives.
The binary blobs make it a little dificult to develop software for the esp since you cant research the inner workings of specific core api calls.

The sdk is based on freertos and give you a task handler asn other abstract os features.
Most of its core api calls are callback based which means you have to think asynchronously when developing.
